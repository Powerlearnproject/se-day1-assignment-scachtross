# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Softawre Engineering involves solving real world problems by building websites,apps,games,systems through writing code.
It is important in the sense that it helps solve real world problems.For example it may have been difficult for developers to collaborate on a project before but sice the coming about of version control like github developers can collaborate from anywhere in the world.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.Object Oriented programming which improved code reusability.This include concepts like;inheritance
2.Cloud computing which has enabled scalability in access to computing power greatly improving softwware deployment.
3.DevOps which has improved collaboration,automation and deployabilty.example;AWS,Azure

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
